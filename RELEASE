Back again with more updates to our Wallet! Here’s what is new:

Onboarding Polish — We updated many steps in our onboarding flow to be clearer and more intuitive. It is easier than ever to set up a new wallet (or get your friends and family to do the same…)

Increased Gas Buffer — We updated our wallet logic to default to leaving a larger quantity of native tokens in your wallet after a swap. With gas prices rising, we want to ensure that users never get stuck without the ability to make a swap! 

Other notable changes:

- External profile UI polish
- Token details page polish
- Bug fixes
