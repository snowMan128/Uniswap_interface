We are back with another (small) round of updates. Check out what is new below:

Token Details Page Improvements — We took a pass at simplifying the core flows of token detail pages. We clarified the language around contract addresses and made it simpler than ever to copy them to your clipboard. In addition, we added a quick and easy route to our ‘receive’ flow from any given token details page. Share (and send) tokens easier than ever with our app!

Other notable changes:

- Gas estimation and approval bug fix
- Updated Twitter icons to ‘X’
- Unsupported language bug fix
- Android bug fixes
