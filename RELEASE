We are back with some new new updates! Here’s the latest:

Support for Blast: We now support the Blast Network! You can now send, receive, swap and more on it. 

Extension Beta Waitlist: If you’ve claimed a Username, you’re automatically added to the waitlist of our newest product, the Uniswap Extension (Beta). If you’re off the waitlist, you’ll receive a notification as such, which will allow you access to try out the product.
